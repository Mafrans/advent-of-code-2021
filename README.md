# Advent of Code 2021
These are my solutions to 2021's AOC challenges, written in Lisp - a language I knew nothing about before starting this project.

## Installing
### SBCL
You will need the Steel Bank Common Lisp implementation of Common Lisp to run any of the scripts. 
Read more at http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html or install it using your favorite package manager ([APT](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/sbcl)) ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sbcl-git/))

### Quicklisp
You will also need the quicklisp package manager to run the scripts, read more at https://www.quicklisp.org/

## Running
Run any of the challenges by using the `./start.sh <day> <part>` utility script.

### Examples
Running day 1, part 1
```
$ ./start.sh 1 1
```
Running day 4, part 2
```
$ ./start.sh 4 3
```
